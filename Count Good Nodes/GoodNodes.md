# Code explanation
This is a JavaScript function that implements a solution to find the number of "good" nodes in a binary tree.

The function starts by initializing a count variable to keep track of the number of good nodes, and a maxSoFar variable to keep track of the maximum node value seen so far.

It then defines a helper function, "dfs", that takes in a node as a parameter. This function uses a depth-first search approach to traverse the binary tree.

The "dfs" function starts by checking if the node is null, and if it is, it returns. If the node is not null, the function then checks if the node's value is greater than or equal to the maxSoFar. If it is, the count is incremented and maxSoFar is updated with the current node's value.

The function then continues the depth-first search by calling itself on the left and right children of the node.

Finally, the function calls the "dfs" function with the root node as the argument and returns the count.

In this implementation, a node is considered "good" if its value is greater than or equal to the maximum value seen so far in the binary tree.

## Helper function (Depth First search)
The depth-first search (DFS) is used to traverse the binary tree in this code. The DFS approach visits all the nodes in the tree by first exploring one branch as far as possible, then backtracking and exploring another branch.

In this code, the DFS is implemented using a helper function called "dfs". The function takes a node as an argument and performs the following steps:

Check if the node is null: If the node is null, the function returns.

Check if the node's value is greater than or equal to maxSoFar: If it is, the count is incremented and maxSoFar is updated with the current node's value.

Recursively call the "dfs" function on the left and right children of the node: This continues the depth-first search and visits all the nodes in the tree.

The DFS approach is used to visit all the nodes in the tree and determine if they are "good" nodes or not. The result of the DFS is stored in the count variable, which keeps track of the number of "good" nodes in the binary tree.

## Treversing left and right subtree
In the "dfs" function, the left and right subtrees of the binary tree are traversed using recursion. Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem.

Here's how the DFS traverses the left and right subtrees of the binary tree:

The "dfs" function is called on the left child of the current node. This causes the function to call itself with the left child as the argument.

The function then checks if the left child is null, and if it is not, it performs steps 2 and 3 from the previous explanation (check if the node's value is greater than or equal to maxSoFar, and recursively call the "dfs" function on the left and right children of the node).

The "dfs" function then continues with step 2 for the right child of the current node.

This process continues until all the nodes in the binary tree have been visited.

By calling itself on the left and right children of each node, the "dfs" function is able to traverse the entire binary tree, visiting each node and counting the number of "good" nodes along the way. The final count is returned as the result of the function.

## why use negative infinity

The choice of negative infinity as the initial value for "maxSoFar" instead of 0 or -1 is because there may be nodes in the binary tree with negative values. If the initial value of "maxSoFar" was set to 0 or -1, it would be possible for a node with a negative value to be considered a "good" node, even though it may not meet the criteria of having a value greater than or equal to the maximum value seen so far in the tree.

By using negative infinity as the initial value, we ensure that any node with a positive value will always be considered a "good" node, regardless of its actual value. This is because negative infinity is the smallest possible value in JavaScript and is less than any negative number.
